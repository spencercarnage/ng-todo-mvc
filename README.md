# ng-todo-mvc
The motto for this repo is ABT: Always Be TodoMVCing.

After working with Angular for over a year it was time to build my own version of 
TodoMVC. What started as a [sloppy Plunker](http://plnkr.co/edit/NV2e5a0DkAAldaLIFTjS?p=preview) 
has turned in this glorious mess of a half-cocked, never-been-kissed work-in-progress. 
Major refactors along with tests are on their way. A lot of things are broken so
don't expect this to work at all.

To Do:

* better names; everything is "todo" or "todos"
* improve folder structure
* more tests
* test coverage
* clicking toggle done button updates list
* clicking toggle done button updates count
